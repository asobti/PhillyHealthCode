Android client for [VitaminME](http://vitaminme.notimplementedexception.me)

Description
-----------

VitaminME is an Android app that allows users to search for food recipes based on their specific nutritional needs. For example, if they want more Vitamin C and Proteins, but less Carbohydrates and Fat, we will give them a list of recipes they can make at home that provides for their needs.

In addition, VitaminME gives the user a detailed breakdown of the nutrients present in this recipe. This includes nutrient amounts and % Daily Values provided by the recipe for each nutrient. This looks exactly like the nutrional chart one would find on an off-the-shelf product at a grocers'. Using VitaminME, users get the same level of information for their home-cooked food as they would if they picked up something off a super mark aisle.
